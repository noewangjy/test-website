In this episode, Matt and Ines of Explosion AI tell us how Prodigy can improve data annotation and model development workflows. Prodigy is an annotation tool implemented as a python library, and it comes with a web application and a command line interface. A developer can define input data streams and design simple annotation interfaces. Prodigy can help break down complex annotation decisions into a series of binary decisions, and it provides easy integration with spaCy models. Developers can specify how models should be modified as new annotations come in in an active learning framework.","soundcloud":"559200912","thumb":"https://i.imgur.com/hOBQEzc.jpg","url":"https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights/78-where-do-corpora-come-from-with-matt-honnibal-and-ines-montani","author":"Matt Gardner, Waleed Ammar (Allen AI)","author_links":{"website":"https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights"},"category":["podcasts"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
