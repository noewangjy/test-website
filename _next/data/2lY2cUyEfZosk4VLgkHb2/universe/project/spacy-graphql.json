The API currently supports most token attributes, named entities, sentences and text categories (if available as `doc.cats`, i.e. if you added a text classifier to a model). The `meta` field will return the model meta data. Models are only loaded once and kept in memory.","url":"https://explosion.ai/demos/spacy-graphql","category":["apis"],"tags":["graphql"],"thumb":"https://i.imgur.com/xC7zpTO.png","code_example":["{","  nlp(text: \"Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook.\", model: \"en_core_web_sm\") {","    meta {","      lang","      description","    }","    doc {","      text","      tokens {","        text","        pos_","      }","      ents {","        text","        label_","      }","    }","  }","}"],"code_language":"json","author":"Ines Montani","author_links":{"twitter":"_inesmontani","github":"ines","website":"https://ines.io"},"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
