Soon afterward, small and big boats sail into Sinjin Port in Taean County, South Chungcheong Province, the second-largest source of blue crab after Incheon, accounting for 29 percent of total production of the country. A crane lifts 28 boxes filled with blue crabs weighing 40 kilograms each from the boat, worth about 10 million won ($8,500). “It has been a productive fall season for crabbing here. The water temperature is a very important factor affecting crab production. They hate cold water,” Lee said. The temperature of the sea off Taean appeared to have stayed at the level where crabs become active. If the sea temperature suddenly drops, crabs go into their winter dormancy mode, burrowing into the mud and sleeping through the cold months.'","","","#Pass text","LingFeat = extractor.pass_text(text)","","","#Preprocess text","LingFeat.preprocess()","","","#Extract features","#each method returns a dictionary of the corresponding features","#Advanced Semantic (AdSem) Features","WoKF = LingFeat.WoKF_() #Wikipedia Knowledge Features","WBKF = LingFeat.WBKF_() #WeeBit Corpus Knowledge Features","OSKF = LingFeat.OSKF_() #OneStopEng Corpus Knowledge Features","","#Discourse (Disco) Features","EnDF = LingFeat.EnDF_() #Entity Density Features","EnGF = LingFeat.EnGF_() #Entity Grid Features","","#Syntactic (Synta) Features","PhrF = LingFeat.PhrF_() #Noun/Verb/Adj/Adv/...
