Inspired by spacy-stanza, this package offers slightly less accurate models that are in turn much faster.","github":"TakeLab/spacy-udpipe","pip":"spacy-udpipe","code_example":["import spacy_udpipe","","spacy_udpipe.download(\"en\") # download English model","","text = \"Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world.\"","nlp = spacy_udpipe.load(\"en\")","","doc = nlp(text)","for token in doc:","    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.dep_)"],"category":["pipeline","standalone","models","research"],"author":"TakeLab","author_links":{"github":"TakeLab","website":"https://takelab.fer.hr/"},"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
