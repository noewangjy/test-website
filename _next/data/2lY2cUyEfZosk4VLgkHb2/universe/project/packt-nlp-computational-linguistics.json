These algorithms are based on statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The tools to work with these algorithms are available to you right now - with Python, and tools like Gensim and spaCy.","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/aleMf1Y.jpg","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Computational-Linguistics-ebook/dp/B07BWH779J","author":"Bhargav Srinivasa-Desikan","category":["books"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
