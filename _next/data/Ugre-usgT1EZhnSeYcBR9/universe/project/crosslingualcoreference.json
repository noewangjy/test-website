In our case, the available training for non-English languages also data proved to be poorly annotated. Crosslingual Coreference therefore uses the assumption a trained model with English data and cross-lingual embeddings should work for other languages with similar sentence structure. Verified to work quite well for at least (EN, NL, DK, FR, DE).","github":"pandora-intelligence/crosslingual-coreference","pip":"crosslingual-coreference","thumb":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pandora-Intelligence/crosslingual-coreference/master/img/logo.png","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pandora-Intelligence/crosslingual-coreference/master/img/example_total.png","code_example":["import spacy","import crosslingual_coreference","","text = \"\"\"","    Do not forget about Momofuku Ando!","    He created instant noodles in Osaka.","    At that location, Nissin was founded.","    Many students survived by eating these noodles, but they don't even know him.\"\"\"","","# use any model that has internal spacy embeddings","nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')","nlp.add_pipe(","    \"xx_coref\", config={\"chunk_size\": 2500, \"chunk_overlap\": 2, \"device\": 0})",")","","doc = nlp(text)","","print(doc._.coref_clusters)","# Output","#","# [[[4, 5], [7, 7], [27, 27], [36, 36]],","# [[12, 12], [15, 16]],","# [[9, 10], [27, 28]],","# [[22, 23], [31, 31]]]","print(doc._.resolved_text)","# Output","#","# Do not forget about Momofuku Ando!","# Momofuku Ando created instant noodles in Osaka.","# At Osaka, Nissin was founded.","# Many students survived by eating instant noodles,","# but Many students don't even know Momofuku Ando."],"author":"David Berenstein","author_links":{"github":"davidberenstein1957","website":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-berenstein-1bab11105/"},"category":["pipeline","standalone"],"tags":["coreference","multi-lingual","cross-lingual","allennlp"],"spacy_version":3,"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
