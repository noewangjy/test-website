Manning, EMNLP 2016. Since ✨Neuralcoref v2.0, you can train the coreference resolution system on your own dataset — e.g., another language than English! — **provided you have an annotated dataset**. Note that to use neuralcoref with spaCy > 2.1.0, you'll have to install neuralcoref from source.","github":"huggingface/neuralcoref","thumb":"https://i.imgur.com/j6FO9O6.jpg","code_example":["import spacy","import neuralcoref","","nlp = spacy.load('en')","neuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)","doc1 = nlp('My sister has a dog.
