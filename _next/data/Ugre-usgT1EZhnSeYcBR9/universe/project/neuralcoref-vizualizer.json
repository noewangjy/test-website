It is a classical Natural language processing task, that has seen a revival of interest in the past two years as several research groups applied cutting-edge deep-learning and reinforcement-learning techniques to it. It is also one of the key building blocks to building conversational Artificial intelligences.","url":"https://huggingface.co/coref/","image":"https://i.imgur.com/3yy4Qyf.png","thumb":"https://i.imgur.com/j6FO9O6.jpg","github":"huggingface/neuralcoref","category":["visualizers","conversational"],"tags":["coref","chatbots"],"author":"Hugging Face","author_links":{"github":"huggingface"},"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
