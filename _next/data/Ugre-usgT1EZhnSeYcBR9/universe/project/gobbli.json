It leverages the abstractive powers of Docker to hide nearly all dependency management and functional differences between models from the user. It also contains an interactive app for exploring text data and evaluating classification models. spaCy's base text classification models, as well as models integrated from `spacy-transformers`, are available in the collection of classification models. In addition, spaCy is used for data augmentation and document embeddings.","url":"https://github.com/rtiinternational/gobbli","github":"rtiinternational/gobbli","pip":"gobbli","thumb":"https://i.postimg.cc/NGpzhrdr/gobbli-lg.png","code_example":["from gobbli.io import PredictInput, TrainInput","from gobbli.model.bert import BERT","","train_input = TrainInput(","    X_train=['This is a training document.', 'This is another training document.'],","    y_train=['0', '1'],","    X_valid=['This is a validation sentence.', 'This is another validation sentence.'],","    y_valid=['1', '0'],",")","","clf = BERT()","","# Set up classifier resources -- Docker image, etc.","clf.build()","","# Train model","train_output = clf.train(train_input)","","predict_input = PredictInput(","    X=['Which class is this document?'],","    labels=train_output.labels,","    checkpoint=train_output.checkpoint,",")","","predict_output = clf.predict(predict_input)"],"category":["standalone"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
