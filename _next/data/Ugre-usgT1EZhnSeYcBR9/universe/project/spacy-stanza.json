Using this wrapper, you'll be able to use the following annotations, computed by your pretrained `stanza` model:\n\n- Statistical tokenization (reflected in the `Doc` and its tokens)\n - Lemmatization (`token.lemma` and `token.lemma_`)\n - Part-of-speech tagging (`token.tag`, `token.tag_`, `token.pos`, `token.pos_`)\n - Dependency parsing (`token.dep`, `token.dep_`, `token.head`)\n - Named entity recognition (`doc.ents`, `token.ent_type`, `token.ent_type_`, `token.ent_iob`, `token.ent_iob_`)\n - Sentence segmentation (`doc.sents`)","github":"explosion/spacy-stanza","pip":"spacy-stanza","thumb":"https://i.imgur.com/myhLjMJ.png","code_example":["import stanza","import spacy_stanza","","stanza.download(\"en\")","nlp = spacy_stanza.load_pipeline(\"en\")","","doc = nlp(\"Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.
