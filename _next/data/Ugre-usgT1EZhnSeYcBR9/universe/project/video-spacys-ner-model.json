The system is designed to give a good balance of efficiency, accuracy and adaptability. In this talk, I sketch out the components of the system, explaining the intuition behind the various choices. I also give a brief introduction to the named entity recognition problem, with an overview of what else Explosion AI is working on, and why.","youtube":"sqDHBH9IjRU","author":"Matthew Honnibal","author_links":{"twitter":"honnibal","github":"honnibal","website":"https://explosion.ai"},"category":["videos"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
