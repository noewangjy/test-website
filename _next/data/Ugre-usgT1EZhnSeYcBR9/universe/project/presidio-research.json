It is used for the evaluation of the entire system, as well as for evaluating specific PII recognizers or PII detection models. Anyone interested in evaluating an existing Microsoft Presidio instance, a specific PII recognizer or to develop new models or logic for detecting PII could leverage the preexisting work in this package. Additionally, anyone interested in generating new data based on previous datasets (e.g. to increase the coverage of entity values) for Named Entity Recognition models could leverage the data generator contained in this package.","url":"https://aka.ms/presidio-research","github":"microsoft/presidio-research","category":["standalone"],"thumb":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722","author":"Microsoft","author_links":{"github":"microsoft"},"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
