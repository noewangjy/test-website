It has achieved State-of-the-Art performance on Named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing for Danish. This repository contains material for using the DaCy, reproducing the results and guides on usage of the package. Furthermore, it also contains a series of behavioural test for biases and robustness of Danish NLP pipelines.","github":"centre-for-humanities-computing/DaCy","pip":"dacy","code_example":["import dacy","print(dacy.models()) # get a list of dacy models","nlp = dacy.load('medium')  # load your spacy pipeline","","# DaCy also includes functionality for adding other Danish models to the pipeline","# For instance you can add the BertTone model for classification of sentiment polarity to the pipeline:","nlp = add_berttone_polarity(nlp)"],"thumb":"https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/DaCy/blob/main/img/icon_no_title.png?raw=true","author":"Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus","author_links":{"github":"centre-for-humanities-computing","website":"https://chcaa.io/#/"},"category":["pipeline"],"tags":["pipeline","danish"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
