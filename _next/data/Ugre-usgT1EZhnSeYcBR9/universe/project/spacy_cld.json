When called on a `Doc` or `Span`, the object is given two attributes: `languages` (a list of up to 3 language codes) and `language_scores` (a dictionary mapping language codes to confidence scores between 0 and 1).\n\nspacy-cld is a little extension that wraps the [PYCLD2](https://github.com/aboSamoor/pycld2) Python library, which in turn wraps the [Compact Language Detector 2](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2) C library originally built at Google for the Chromium project. CLD2 uses character n-grams as features and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify 80+ languages from Unicode text strings (or XML/HTML). It can detect up to 3 different languages in a given document, and reports a confidence score (reported in with each language.","github":"nickdavidhaynes/spacy-cld","pip":"spacy_cld","code_example":["import spacy","from spacy_cld import LanguageDetector","","nlp = spacy.load('en')","language_detector = LanguageDetector()","nlp.add_pipe(language_detector)","doc = nlp('This is some English text.')","","doc._.languages  # ['en']","doc._.language_scores['en']  # 0.96"],"author":"Nicholas D Haynes","author_links":{"github":"nickdavidhaynes"},"category":["pipeline"],"isProject":true},"section":"universe","sectionTitle":"Universe","theme":"purple"},"__N_SSG":true}
